> You do not need to read every diff to demand proof.

Coding agents are useful. Their transcripts are not proof. `goal-cli` gives
non-coders a control loop above the coding agent: define the output, rebuild it
every heartbeat, let a separate critic review the artifact, and only repair
source when the artifact fails.

## Who It Helps

| You are | The artifact you can judge | What the agent must prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scholar | Paper, appendix, replication packet | The PDF rebuilds and the critique points at the artifact, not the chat. |
| Designer | Poster, landing page, campaign visual | The exported page or image matches the brief you can see. |
| Hobbyist | Your own small app | The app runs, the demo changes, and the next heartbeat shows it. |
| Accountant | Financial report, workbook, reconciliation export | Tables, numbers, and files regenerate before you review them. |
| Brokerage analyst | Sell-side research report, chart pack, sector note | Charts, tables, wording, and sources update in the rebuilt report. |

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Create, validate, and run a goal:

```bash
goal-cli init
$EDITOR goal.toml
goal-cli validate
goal-cli doctor
goal-cli run
goal-cli state
```

For model-based artifact critique:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[openai]'
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
goal-cli doctor
```

Use `goal-cli doctor --smoke-codex-goal` when setup should prove the internal
Codex `/goal` tok path too. Use `--skip-openai-auth` only when auth is supplied
outside the environment.

## The Loop

```mermaid

    config["goal.toml"] --> producer["producer command"]
    producer --> artifact["canonical artifact"]
    artifact --> tik{"tik review"}
    tik -- "passes" --> complete["complete"]
    tik -- "fails" --> report["tik.md"]
    report --> tok["tok source repair"]
    tok --> next["next heartbeat"]
    next --> producer
```

One run is one heartbeat:

| Runtime action | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Load file-backed state and acquire a lock | A heartbeat is single-owner. |
| Run the producer command | The artifact must exist before critique. |
| Run `tik` against the artifact | The critic sees the product, not the source diff. |
| Launch `tok` only on failure | Repair stays inside configured writable scopes. |
| Record state and exit | Liveness is explicit and recoverable. |

## Why It Exists

| When coding agents feel like magic | `goal-cli` gives you a handle |
| --- | --- |
| "The agent says it fixed the app." | The site or build artifact is regenerated before the goal can pass. |
| "I cannot audit the diff." | Judge the artifact: paper, poster, report, research report, dataset, or app. |
| "The chat got too long to trust." | State, prompts, reports, locks, and traces live under `.goal/`. |
| "The repair pass declared success." | `tok` can only change sources. Completion belongs to artifact review. |
| "I need a stronger final standard." | `tik` reviews the artifact after rebuild, not the agent's explanation. |

You stay in charge of the parts you can judge:

| You decide | `goal-cli` enforces |
| --- | --- |
| The artifact that counts | The producer must rebuild it before any success claim matters. |
| The review standard | `tik` critiques the artifact and writes `tik.md` for the repair pass. |
| The writable surface | `tok` repairs only the configured source directories. |
| The heartbeat | Every run records state, traces, reports, and the next action. |

## Configuration

A goal is one `goal.toml` file:

```toml
name = "paper-ready"
state_dir = ".goal"
runs_dir = ".goal/runs"

[artifact]
path = "output/full_paper.pdf"
copy_as = "full_paper.pdf"

[producer]
command = "make all"

[tik]
provider = "oracle"
command = "python3 scripts/tik.py"

[tok]
provider = "codex_goal"
write_dirs = ["writing", "src"]
sandbox = "workspace-write"
codex_features = ["goals"]

[safety]
generated_dirs = ["output", "build"]
max_blocker_repeats = 3
```

For a PDF-first research workflow:

```bash
cp examples/scientificity/goal.toml ./goal.toml
```

Then edit artifact paths, write scopes, tik provider settings, and the producer
command for that repository.

## Runtime Roles

| Role | Job | Hard boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Producer | Rebuild the artifact from source | Must create `[artifact].path`. |
| Tik | Critique the artifact | Sees the product, writes `tik.md`. |
| Tok | Repair source files | Edits only configured `write_dirs`. |
| Heartbeat | Own liveness and state | Runs once, records, exits. |
| Git gate | Protect transitions | Optional no-mistakes checkpoint and review. |

Public `tik` modes:

- `oracle`: deterministic scripts, tests, metrics, or machine checks.
- `agent`: OpenAI Responses API file-upload artifact critique.
- `codex_file`: Codex critique of a local artifact copy in a read-only
  single-file workspace.

Production `tok` mode:

- `codex_goal`: launches an internal Codex `/goal` with a JSON Schema-checked
  final report.

## Command Deck

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `goal-cli init` | Create a starter `goal.toml`. |
| `goal-cli validate` | Check config, artifact paths, and writable scopes. |
| `goal-cli doctor` | Check whether this goal can run end to end. |
| `goal-cli run` | Execute one autonomous heartbeat. |
| `goal-cli tik` | Run producer plus tik, but skip tok. |
| `goal-cli render-prompts` | Write rendered tik and tok prompts into a run directory. |
| `goal-cli state` | Print `.goal/state.json` or the default initial state. |
| `goal-cli reset` | Remove state and stale locks while preserving run artifacts. |

<details>
  <summary><strong>Observability</strong></summary>

OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled by default. Runtime spans cover the heartbeat,
producer, artifact load, tik, tok, and no-mistakes gate.

Default endpoint:

```toml
[observability]
service_name = "goal-cli"
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
timeout_seconds = 5
```

If no configured OTLP receiver is reachable and no OTLP endpoint was explicitly
set through the environment, `goal-cli` writes local fallback traces to:

```text
.goal/observability/traces.jsonl
```

For collector-managed local traces:

```bash
mkdir -p .goal/observability
cp docs/otel-collector-file.yaml .goal/observability/otel-collector.yaml
docker run --rm --name goal-cli-otel \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -v "$PWD/.goal/observability:/observability" \
  -v "$PWD/.goal/observability/otel-collector.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml:ro" \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest \
  --config=/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Git Gate</strong></summary>

`goal-cli` can hand committed checkpoints to
[`kunchenguid/no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).
The gate is enabled by default:

```toml
[no_mistakes]
enabled = true
binary = "no-mistakes"
mode = "lightspeed"
branch_prefix = "goal-cli"
```

When enabled, non-dry-run heartbeats start from a clean Git worktree. If the
repo is on the default branch, `goal-cli` creates a `goal-cli/...` feature
branch. Runtime files under `.goal/` are excluded through `.git/info/exclude`.

`mode = "lightspeed"` uses no-mistakes with high-latency steps skipped. Use
`mode = "fast"` or `mode = "full"` when a branch needs stronger local or
release gates.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Internal Shape</strong></summary>

The implementation keeps four seams narrow:

| Seam | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Git Gate | `NoMistakesGate` owns clean checkpoints, feature branches, skip presets, readiness flags, and `no-mistakes axi run`. |
| Heartbeat State | `HeartbeatRecorder` owns state, history, heartbeat emission, transitions, and no-mistakes state recording. |
| Tok Execution | `tok_execution` owns Codex `/goal` command construction, JSON Schema validation, prompt files, reports, and diagnostics. |
| Readiness and Telemetry | `doctor` and runtime share tok execution and `TelemetryExportPlan`, so setup checks describe the real path. |
</details>

```bash

## Status

`goal-cli` is early local tooling, currently published as version `0.1.0`.
It is useful when you already know the artifact, producer command, evaluator,
and writable source surface.

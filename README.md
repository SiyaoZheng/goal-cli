Coding agents love code.

You want the thing.

Not a diff.

Not a status update.

Not "almost done."

The thing.

The PDF.

The website.

The report.

The chart pack.

The app demo.

`goal-cli` keeps the thing in the center.

It rebuilds the thing.

It checks the thing.

If the thing is not good enough, the agent gets another work pass.

Chat confidence does not count.

The thing does.

## Quick Start

Paste one sentence into your coding agent.

```text
Hi, read https://github.com/SiyaoZheng/goal-cli/blob/master/llms.txt and do what it says.
```

That is it.

The details live in [`llms.txt`](llms.txt).

The agent reads them.

You judge the thing.

## Name The Thing

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/goal-cli-personas-human.png" alt="Scholars, designers, hobbyists, accountants, and analysts each holding the thing they need a coding agent to finish" width="100%" />
</p>

Different people.

Different things.

Same rule.

Name it.

Make the agent come back to it.

| Who | What they say |
| --- | --- |
| <img alt="Scholar" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/scholar-34d399?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=062014" /> | "Show me the PDF." |
| <img alt="Designer" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/designer-f59e0b?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=241504" /> | "Show me the poster." |
| <img alt="Hobbyist" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/hobbyist-60a5fa?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=071426" /> | "Does my app run?" |
| <img alt="Accountant" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/accountant-a78bfa?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=160d24" /> | "Do the numbers tie?" |
| <img alt="Analyst" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/analyst-f87171?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=240909" /> | "Does the chart move?" |

## What It Does

One prompt.

One thing.

One heartbeat every 30 minutes.

| Move | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| <img alt="Rebuild" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/rebuild-22c55e?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=052e16" /> | Rebuild the thing. |
| <img alt="Check" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/check-eab308?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=332600" /> | Check the thing. |
| <img alt="Source" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/source-3b82f6?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=082f49" /> | Change only allowed source files. |
| <img alt="Repeat" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/repeat-ef4444?style=flat-square&amp;labelColor=3b0909" /> | Try again on the next heartbeat. |

The question is not:

"Did the agent change code?"

The question is:

"Is the thing better?"

| You care about | The agent must prove |
| --- | --- |
| A paper | The PDF is rebuilt and worth reading. |
| A website | The built page opens and looks right. |
| A report | The numbers and narrative are inspectable. |
| A chart pack | The exported charts are current. |
| A demo app | The app runs in the expected state. |

## The Science Behind It

People are calling this
[loop engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/).

The hype says:

Do not write one perfect prompt.

Build a loop.

Make it run.

Make it check.

Make it try again.

`goal-cli` is that idea for normal people.

Every heartbeat asks:

Did the thing get better?

If yes, stop.

If no, change source and come back in 30 minutes.

### How It Works

The setup file is `goal.toml`. It answers a few plain questions:

| Question | In `goal.toml` |
| --- | --- |
| What finished output should I inspect? | `[artifact].path` |
| How do I rebuild it? | `[producer].command` |
| How should it be checked? | `[tik]` |
| Which source files count as valid tok edits? | `[tok].write_dirs` |
| Where may runtime commands produce side effects? | `[tok].runtime_write_dirs` |

You may see these short names in the config and deeper docs:

| Name | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `artifact` | The finished output you can inspect. |
| `producer` | The command that rebuilds that output. |
| `tik` | The reviewer that rejects weak output. |
| `tok` | The coding agent that changes source files under the audited source scope. |
| `.goal/` | The folder where runs, reviews, and state are recorded. |

Example:

```toml
name = "paper-ready"
state_dir = ".goal"
runs_dir = ".goal/runs"

[artifact]
path = "outputs/writing/full_paper.pdf"
copy_as = "full_paper.pdf"

[producer]
command = "python3 scripts/orchestrator.py --full"

[tik]
provider = "codex_file"
timeout_seconds = 1800
max_file_size_bytes = 25000000
max_output_tokens = 4096

[tok]
provider = "codex_goal"
write_dirs = ["src", "data"]
run_cwd = "."
runtime_write_dirs = ["outputs", "build", "logs"]
sandbox = "workspace-write"
codex_features = ["goals"]

[safety]
generated_dirs = ["outputs", "build", "logs"]
max_blocker_repeats = 3
```

To run several reviewers at once, move provider-specific fields into
`[[tik.providers]]`. The heartbeat runs them in parallel and hands tok one
aggregate `tik.md` containing every provider result.

```toml
[tik]
timeout_seconds = 1800

[[tik.providers]]
label = "codex"
provider = "codex_file"

[[tik.providers]]
label = "claude"
provider = "claude_code_file"

[[tik.providers]]
label = "checklist"
provider = "checklist"
command = "python3 scripts/checklist_review.py"
```

Use `codex_app_server` instead of `codex_goal` when tok should drive Codex
through `codex app-server --stdio` rather than `codex exec`. Swap
`codex_file` for `claude_code_file` and `codex_goal` for `claude_code_goal` to
run the same loop through Claude Code instead of Codex;
[`examples/scientificity-claude/goal.toml`](examples/scientificity-claude/goal.toml)
is the all-Claude version of this setup.

Use `checklist` for command-backed checklist reviews that should appear as
their own tik provider in ledgers and state.

The important boundary is simple: the fixing agent edits source, but the final
result has to be rebuilt and checked before the work counts as done.

### Installing From This Checkout

If you are working inside the `goal-cli` repository itself:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -e '.[openai]'
goal-cli --help
```

Use the basic install without OpenAI support when you only need local checks:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `goal-cli init` | Create a starter `goal.toml`. |
| `goal-cli validate` | Check that the config is shaped correctly. |
| `goal-cli doctor` | Check whether the local setup is ready to run. |
| `goal-cli run --dry-run` | Render the prompts and run folder without calling repair agents. |
| `goal-cli run --max-minutes 30` | Run one bounded work pass. |
| `goal-cli heartbeat install --every-minutes 60 --max-minutes 30` | Install a per-user OS timer that triggers one heartbeat per tick. |
| `goal-cli heartbeat status` | Show the OS timer status and managed paths. |
| `goal-cli tik` | Rebuild and review the output without running a repair pass. |
| `goal-cli state` | Show the current saved state. |
| `goal-cli cleanup` | Clear stale locks after an interrupted run. |
| `goal-cli reset` | Remove saved state while keeping run records. |

### Agent Skills

If your coding agent supports skills, install the setup skill:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex/skills"
cp -R skills/goal-cli-project-setup "$HOME/.codex/skills/"
```

Use [`goal-cli-project-setup`](skills/goal-cli-project-setup/SKILL.md) for real
projects. Use
[`goal-cli-template-author`](skills/goal-cli-template-author/SKILL.md) only when
you are improving reusable examples or docs in this repository.

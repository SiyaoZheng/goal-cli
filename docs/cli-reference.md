# goal-cli CLI Reference

`goal-cli` is an `argparse` CLI. The parser generates `-h` and `--help`
output from the same command definitions used at runtime.

## Top Level

Omitting the command defaults to `run`. Global options must appear before the
subcommand.

```text
usage: goal-cli [-h] [-c CONFIG]
                {init,validate,doctor,run,tik,heartbeat,state,reset,cleanup,render-prompts} ...

Configure and run artifact-centered heartbeats for coding agents.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --config CONFIG   Path to goal.toml (default: goal.toml)

commands:
  {init,validate,doctor,run,tik,heartbeat,state,reset,cleanup,render-prompts}
    init                Create a starter artifact goal.toml
    validate            Validate goal.toml, prompt placeholders, and writable
                        scopes
    doctor              Check setup readiness before a heartbeat
    run                 Run one autonomous heartbeat
    tik                 Rebuild the artifact and run tik review, but skip tok
    heartbeat           Install or run the system-level heartbeat
    state               Print state JSON or the default initial state
    reset               Remove state and stale lock while preserving run
                        artifacts
    cleanup             Clean interrupted heartbeat locks and optional orphan
                        provider processes
    render-prompts      Render tik and tok prompts without running providers

Omitting the command defaults to run. Use 'goal-cli <command> -h' for
subcommand options.
```

## Run

```text
usage: goal-cli run [-h] [--dry-run] [--max-minutes MAX_MINUTES]

Run exactly one heartbeat: producer rebuild, tik review, then tok only if
review fails.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dry-run             Create a run directory and render prompts without
                        running producer, tik, or tok
  --max-minutes MAX_MINUTES
                        Maximum wall-clock minutes for the heartbeat,
                        including providers and no-mistakes
```

## Doctor

```text
usage: goal-cli doctor [-h] [--smoke-codex-goal]
                       [--smoke-codex-app-server]
                       [--smoke-claude-code-goal]
                       [--smoke-codex-file-tik] [--smoke-claude-code-file-tik]
                       [--skip-openai-auth]
                       [--timeout-seconds TIMEOUT_SECONDS]
                       [--smoke-timeout-seconds SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS]

Check config, commands, providers, and smoke prerequisites before a real
heartbeat.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --smoke-codex-goal    Run a minimal Codex /goal schema-output smoke check in
                        a temp directory
  --smoke-codex-app-server
                        Run a minimal Codex app-server stdio tok smoke check
                        in a temp directory
  --smoke-claude-code-goal
                        Run a minimal Claude Code structured-output tok smoke
                        check in a temp directory
  --smoke-codex-file-tik
                        Run a minimal Codex local-file tik smoke check in a
                        temp directory
  --smoke-claude-code-file-tik
                        Run a minimal Claude Code local-file tik smoke check
                        in a temp directory
  --skip-openai-auth    Skip API key readiness check for API tik configs
  --timeout-seconds TIMEOUT_SECONDS
                        Timeout for setup probes except optional provider
                        smoke checks
  --smoke-timeout-seconds SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS
                        Timeout for optional provider smoke checks
```

Command-backed tik providers (`oracle` and `checklist`) are covered by the
default static command checks. There is no separate checklist smoke flag.

## Tik

```text
usage: goal-cli tik [-h]

Run producer plus tik against the configured artifact without source changes.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## System-Level Heartbeat

The system-level heartbeat installs an OS timer. Each tick still runs exactly
one `goal-cli` heartbeat; it does not add multi-cycle behavior inside the CLI.

```text
usage: goal-cli heartbeat [-h] {install,status,uninstall,paths,tick} ...

Manage an OS-level timer that starts one hardened heartbeat tick per schedule.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

heartbeat commands:
  {install,status,uninstall,paths,tick}
    install             Install and start the OS-level heartbeat timer
    status              Show OS-level heartbeat service status
    uninstall           Stop and remove the OS-level heartbeat service
    paths               Print OS-level heartbeat file and log paths
    tick                Run one hardened heartbeat tick for the OS scheduler
```

```text
usage: goal-cli heartbeat install [-h] [--manager {auto,launchd,systemd-user}]
                                  [--label LABEL]
                                  [--every-minutes EVERY_MINUTES]
                                  [--max-minutes MAX_MINUTES] [--no-start]
                                  [--force] [--dry-run]

Install a launchd LaunchAgent on macOS or a systemd user timer on Linux.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --manager {auto,launchd,systemd-user}
                        OS service manager to use
  --label LABEL         Override the generated service label
  --every-minutes EVERY_MINUTES
                        Timer interval in minutes; must be positive
  --max-minutes MAX_MINUTES
                        Maximum wall-clock minutes for each heartbeat tick
  --no-start            Write service files but do not load or start the timer
  --force               Overwrite an existing goal-cli-managed service file
  --dry-run             Print files and commands without writing or starting
                        anything
```

```text
usage: goal-cli heartbeat tick [-h] [--max-minutes MAX_MINUTES]

Clean stale heartbeat state, run exactly one heartbeat, and treat active locks
as a skipped tick.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --max-minutes MAX_MINUTES
                        Maximum wall-clock minutes for this heartbeat tick
```

`goal-cli heartbeat install` writes a per-user LaunchAgent on macOS and a
per-user systemd service/timer on Linux. The generated service calls
`goal-cli -c /absolute/path/to/goal.toml heartbeat tick --max-minutes ...`,
uses the project root as its working directory, and writes service logs under
`.goal/system-heartbeat/`.

`heartbeat tick` first runs runtime cleanup for stale locks/interrupted phases,
then calls the same one-heartbeat runtime as `goal-cli run`. If another
heartbeat is currently active, the tick exits successfully after logging a
skipped tick so the OS scheduler does not mark normal overlap as a failure.

## Cleanup

```text
usage: goal-cli cleanup [-h] [--kill-orphans]

Remove stale heartbeat locks, mark interrupted running phases, and optionally
stop orphan provider processes for this project.

options:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  --kill-orphans  Terminate orphan goal-cli/Codex processes for this project
                  when no live heartbeat lock exists
```

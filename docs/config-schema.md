# goal.toml Schema

`goal.toml` defines one thing-centered goal. The runtime state belongs under
`.goal/`; the finished thing is the only success standard.

## Top-Level Fields

```toml
name = "artifact-goal"
state_dir = ".goal"
runs_dir = ".goal/runs"

[project]
root = "."
```

- `name`: stable goal name written to state and heartbeat files.
- `state_dir`: directory for `state.json`, `heartbeat.json`, and the lock.
- `runs_dir`: per-heartbeat logs, prompts, verdicts, schemas, and reports.
- `[project].root`: optional project root. Relative paths in the rest of the
  config resolve from this root; it defaults to the directory containing
  `goal.toml`.

## Artifact

```toml
[artifact]
path = "output/artifact.pdf"
copy_as = "full_paper.pdf"
```

- `path`: finished thing produced by the rebuild command.
- `copy_as`: optional filename used when passing the artifact to tik.

## Producer

```toml
[producer]
command = "make all"
```

The producer must rebuild the finished thing from source. Completion is never
accepted from source edits alone.

## Tik

Tik has four public modes.

```toml
[tik]
provider = "oracle"
command = "python3 scripts/tik.py"
```

Use `oracle` for deterministic scripts, tests, metrics, or other machine
checks. The command receives:

- `GOAL_ARTIFACT`
- `GOAL_TIK_PROMPT`
- `GOAL_RUN_DIR`

```toml
[tik]
provider = "agent"
model = "gpt-5.5-pro"
timeout_seconds = 1800
max_file_size_bytes = 25000000
max_output_tokens = 4096
store = false
```

Use `agent` for model-based artifact critique. The configured artifact is copied
to a temporary directory before critique, then uploaded to the OpenAI Responses
API as an `input_file`.

```toml
[tik]
provider = "codex_file"
# model = "optional model override"
timeout_seconds = 1800
max_file_size_bytes = 25000000
```

Use `codex_file` for Codex-based artifact critique without Responses file
upload. The configured artifact is copied into a temporary directory, Codex is
launched with that directory as its workspace under a read-only sandbox, with no
project source directories added to the session, and with ephemeral session
state.

```toml
[tik]
provider = "claude_code_file"
# model = "optional model override"
timeout_seconds = 1800
max_file_size_bytes = 25000000
```

Use `claude_code_file` for Claude Code-based artifact critique. The configured
artifact is copied into a temporary directory, `claude --print` is launched
with that directory as its working directory, with no project source
directories in the workspace, and with `Write`, `Edit`, `NotebookEdit`, and
`Bash` explicitly disallowed so the pass is read-only. The memo is extracted
from the `result` field of the `--output-format json` envelope.

For both `codex_file` and `claude_code_file`, if the configured tik prompt
starts with a slash skill such as `/apsr-review`, goal-cli keeps that slash
command as the first stdin line.

Tik output must contain a JSON object with the configured verdict fields:

```toml
[tik.verdict]
ready_field = "artifact_ready"
blockers_field = "blocking_objections"
required_fields = ["artifact_ready", "blocking_objections"]
fingerprint_fields = ["blocking_objections", "central_bottleneck"]
```

The default verdict shape is:

```json
{
  "artifact_ready": false,
  "central_bottleneck": "one sentence",
  "blocking_objections": [],
  "required_next_artifact_changes": [],
  "current_artifact_sha256": "optional current artifact sha256"
}
```

Freshness fields are optional but enforced when present. If a verdict says
`review_matches_current_pdf = false`, or if `current_pdf_sha256`,
`current_artifact_sha256`, `reviewed_pdf_sha256`, or
`reviewed_artifact_sha256` does not match the runtime artifact hash, the run
records `blocked_stale_tik_review` and asks for a fresh tik pass before tok.

Each tik pass writes `tik.md` in the run directory. That Markdown ledger is the
machine handoff to tok: it includes artifact metadata, the raw tik memo, and the
parsed tik verdict JSON. Tok normally receives the review as a file attachment
through `{tik_review_path}` rather than inline prompt text, so long reviews do
not inflate the `/goal` prompt.

## Tok

The production Tok mode is `codex_goal`.

```toml
[tok]
provider = "codex_goal"
write_dirs = ["src", "data"]
run_cwd = "."
runtime_write_dirs = ["output", "build", "logs"]
sandbox = "workspace-write"
codex_features = ["goals"]
```

`codex_goal` launches `codex exec` with `/goal`, `--enable goals`, and the tok
report schema. Tok treats every pass as the last pass: read `tik.md`, use the
tik review as the standard to meet, edit source under `write_dirs`, and leave
source ready for the next artifact to answer the review's blocking objections.
`write_dirs` are the protocol and audit boundary for source edits, not a hard
OS sandbox guarantee when `run_cwd` or trusted sandbox modes grant broader local
authority. The runtime snapshots these directories before and after tok, records
the actual changed paths, and blocks successful tok reports that make no source
change. `write_dirs` must stay inside the project root and must not overlap
`.git`, state directories, run directories, generated directories, or the
canonical artifact.

`run_cwd` controls the working directory passed to `codex exec -C`. It defaults
to the first `write_dirs` entry for backward compatibility. Set it to `"."`
when the producer or diagnostics must be launched from the project root.

`runtime_write_dirs` is intentionally separate from `write_dirs`. It grants the
tok process access to directories that may be updated by commands it runs, such
as `output`, `build`, or `logs`, without declaring those directories as source
edit scopes. Runtime write dirs may overlap generated directories and the
artifact output directory, but they must stay inside the project root and must
not be the project root, `.git`, the goal config, or goal state/run directories.
The runtime records artifact provenance before and after tok in
`tok_artifact_provenance.json`; the next producer pass records
`producer_artifact_provenance.json` so the next producer/tik pass can be traced
to a rebuilt artifact, not just a tok claim.

Tok reports must match this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "source_change_possible": true,
  "revision_strategy": "one sentence",
  "expected_artifact_visible_improvement": ["visible change in next artifact"],
  "remaining_artifact_bottleneck": "one sentence"
}
```

If no source change is possible, tok reports
`"source_change_possible": false`; the runtime records
`blocked_no_source_change_possible`.
Tok does not report changed file paths. The runtime writes the local evidence to
`tok_source_changes.json` and stores it in state as
`last_tok.actual_sources_changed`.

## no-mistakes Gate

`goal-cli` can use `kunchenguid/no-mistakes` as the Git gate for heartbeat
checkpoints.

```toml
[no_mistakes]
binary = "no-mistakes"
mode = "lightspeed"
intent = "Rebuild, review, update source, and keep Git clean."
skip_steps = []
timeout_seconds = 0
checkpoint_message = "goal-cli checkpoint: {goal_name} heartbeat {iteration} {phase}"
```

- `enabled`: defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` only for isolated tests or
  diagnostics that intentionally run outside Git.
- `binary`: executable used for `no-mistakes`.
- `mode`: no-mistakes pipeline preset. Defaults to `lightspeed`, which passes
  `--skip review,test,document,lint,push,pr,ci`. `fast` skips only
  `push,pr,ci`. `full` runs no-mistakes without preset skips.
- `branch_prefix`: accepted for older configs but ignored. goal-cli is a
  single-person mainline workflow and does not create feature branches.
- `intent`: optional text passed to `no-mistakes axi run --intent`. If omitted,
  goal-cli generates a thing-centered intent from the goal name.
- `skip_steps`: optional no-mistakes pipeline steps for `--skip`, such as
  `["test", "lint"]`. These are added to the selected `mode` preset.
- `timeout_seconds`: process timeout for `no-mistakes` commands; `0` means no
  timeout.
- `checkpoint_message`: Git commit message template. Available placeholders are
  `{goal_name}`, `{iteration}`, and `{phase}`.

When enabled, goal-cli prepares the repo before a non-dry-run heartbeat by
ignoring `.goal/` in `.git/info/exclude` and checkpointing dirty project
changes on the current branch. After successful tok and completion heartbeats,
it checkpoints again. On non-default branches it then runs `no-mistakes init`
and:

```bash
no-mistakes axi run --intent "<configured or generated intent>" --yes [--skip ...]
```

On default branches such as `main` or `master`, goal-cli keeps the
single-person mainline branch, records `no_mistakes_default_branch_skipped`,
and does not invoke `no-mistakes axi run`, because no-mistakes refuses to
validate default branches and asks users to create a feature branch.

Missing Git setup, a missing no-mistakes binary, or a failed gate records
`blocked_no_mistakes_failed`.

If the heartbeat wall-clock budget is exhausted during no-mistakes preparation
or gating, the runtime records `budget_limited` with `next_action = "tik"` so a
later heartbeat can continue from file state.

## Observability

OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled by default and exports standard OTLP HTTP
traces. `goal-cli` only instruments runtime stages; collectors, storage, and
dashboards come from existing OpenTelemetry-compatible tools. If the configured
OTLP receiver is not reachable and no OTLP endpoint was explicitly set through
the environment, `goal-cli` writes local fallback traces to
`.goal/observability/traces.jsonl`. For collector-managed agent-side
observation, use `docs/otel-collector-file.yaml` with OpenTelemetry Collector
Contrib and read `.goal/observability/traces.json`.

```toml
[observability]
service_name = "goal-cli"
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
timeout_seconds = 5
```

- `enabled`: defaults to `true`.
- `service_name`: OpenTelemetry `service.name` resource attribute.
- `endpoint`: OTLP HTTP traces endpoint used when
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` are not
  set.
- `timeout_seconds`: OTLP exporter timeout used when OpenTelemetry timeout env
  vars are not set.

Standard OpenTelemetry environment variables are respected. Set
`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` or `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` for isolated tests.
Environment-provided OTLP endpoints are treated as explicit operator intent and
are not replaced by the local JSONL fallback.

Emitted spans include:

- `goal_cli.heartbeat.run`
- `goal_cli.heartbeat`
- `goal_cli.producer`
- `goal_cli.artifact.load`
- `goal_cli.tik`
- `goal_cli.tok`
- `goal_cli.no_mistakes.prepare`
- `goal_cli.no_mistakes.gate`

## Prompt Placeholders

Tik prompts may use:

- `{goal_name}`
- `{artifact_path}`
- `{artifact_sha256}`
- `{producer_command}`

Tok prompts may use:

- `{goal_name}`
- `{producer_command}`
- `{artifact_path}`
- `{artifact_sha256}`
- `{tik_review_path}`
- `{writable_scopes}`
- `{runtime_writable_scopes}`
- `{tok_run_cwd}`
- `{run_dir}`

Runtime prompts must stay closed-system. They may describe the artifact,
producer, tik ledger, source boundaries, budgets, and operational
impossibilities. They must not include a person-facing approval, clarification,
or decision path.

## Safety

```toml
[safety]
generated_dirs = ["output", "build"]
max_blocker_repeats = 3
lock_stale_seconds = 21600
max_history_items = 50
```

- `generated_dirs`: protected generated outputs; tok write scopes cannot
  overlap them.
- `max_blocker_repeats`: repeated identical tik objections block the run.
- `lock_stale_seconds`: stale lock age.
- `max_history_items`: retained state history entries.

## Runtime States

State is stored in `.goal/state.json`; each run also writes heartbeat and
provider evidence under `.goal/runs/`.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `active` | The goal can continue on a later heartbeat. |
| `complete` | The rebuilt artifact passed tik. |
| `blocked_producer_failed` | The producer command failed. |
| `blocked_artifact_missing` | The producer finished but `[artifact].path` was missing. |
| `blocked_tik_failed` | The tik provider failed before producing a memo. |
| `blocked_unparseable_tik` | Tik output did not contain the configured verdict JSON. |
| `blocked_stale_tik_review` | Tik reviewed a stale artifact hash or declared the review stale. |
| `blocked_tok_failed` | The tok provider failed or returned an invalid schema report. |
| `blocked_no_source_change_possible` | Tok reported that no source change is possible. |
| `blocked_tok_no_source_changes` | Tok returned success but the runtime found no changes under `tok.write_dirs`. |
| `blocked_repeated_same_objection` | The configured blocker fingerprint repeated too many times. |
| `blocked_no_mistakes_failed` | Git setup, checkpointing, or no-mistakes gating failed. |
| `budget_limited` | The heartbeat wall-clock budget expired during no-mistakes work. |

## Setup Readiness

Run:

```bash
goal-cli doctor
```

Doctor is the static readiness gate for configured artifact execution. It
checks:

- config validity, prompt placeholders, closed-system prompt language, and
  writable-scope safety;
- artifact, state, and run directory creatability;
- configured producer command availability where the shell command is statically
  knowable;
- oracle tik command availability where applicable;
- Codex CLI availability;
- OpenTelemetry package availability and the runtime telemetry export plan
  (OTLP when reachable or explicitly environment-configured, local JSONL
  fallback otherwise);
- `codex exec` support for `--output-schema`, `--output-last-message`,
  `--enable`, `--add-dir`, `--sandbox`, and `--ephemeral` when
  `tik.provider = "codex_file"`;
- agent tik `openai` package and `OPENAI_API_KEY` readiness when
  `tik.provider = "agent"`.

The default summary reports `static_setup`. If it is ready, `goal-cli run` has
the local setup required to start the producer/tik/tok loop for the
finished thing.

For an opt-in tok smoke check:

```bash
goal-cli doctor --smoke-codex-goal
```

The smoke check starts a minimal internal Codex `/goal` in a temporary writable
directory, asks it to create a temporary source file, and validates the
schema-shaped tok report. It does not touch project sources.

For `tik.provider = "codex_file"`, also run:

```bash
goal-cli doctor --smoke-codex-goal --smoke-codex-file-tik
```

The second smoke check copies a tiny temporary artifact into a single-file
Codex workspace, runs the same local-file tik adapter used at runtime, and
validates the configured tik verdict fields. `one_click_artifact_loop` is only
ready after all required smoke checks for the configured providers pass.

Clean up an interrupted heartbeat:

```bash
goal-cli cleanup
```

The cleanup command removes a stale heartbeat lock whose process is already
dead and marks a running heartbeat as interrupted. To also terminate orphan
goal-cli/Codex processes that still reference the current project, use:

```bash
goal-cli cleanup --kill-orphans
```

Install an OS-level timed heartbeat:

```bash
goal-cli heartbeat install --every-minutes 30 --max-minutes 30
goal-cli heartbeat status
```

The system-level timer does not change the config schema and does not create a
multi-cycle runtime mode. It writes per-user scheduler files for the current
project and each OS tick invokes one hardened `heartbeat tick`, which cleans
stale runtime state and then executes the same one-heartbeat runtime as
`goal-cli run`.

## Runtime Units

- `heartbeat`: one autonomous producer/tik/tok pass.
- `run`: one CLI invocation that executes exactly one heartbeat.
- `heartbeat tick`: one scheduler-safe invocation that cleans stale runtime
  state, runs one heartbeat, and exits successfully if another heartbeat is
  already active.
- `heartbeat install`: OS scheduler setup for repeated one-heartbeat ticks.

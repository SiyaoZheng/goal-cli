# goal.toml Schema

`goal.toml` defines one artifact-centered goal. The runtime state belongs under
`.goal/`; the artifact is the only success standard.

## Top-Level Fields

```toml
name = "artifact-goal"
state_dir = ".goal"
runs_dir = ".goal/runs"
```

- `name`: stable goal name written to state and heartbeat files.
- `state_dir`: directory for `state.json`, `heartbeat.json`, and the lock.
- `runs_dir`: per-heartbeat logs, prompts, verdicts, schemas, and reports.

## Artifact

```toml
[artifact]
path = "output/artifact.pdf"
copy_as = "full_paper.pdf"
```

- `path`: canonical product produced by the producer command.
- `copy_as`: optional filename used when passing the artifact to tik.

## Producer

```toml
[producer]
command = "make all"
```

The producer must rebuild the canonical artifact from source. Completion is
never accepted from source edits alone.

## Tik

Tik has exactly two public modes.

```toml
[tik]
provider = "oracle"
command = "python3 scripts/tik.py"
```

Use `oracle` for deterministic scripts, tests, metrics, or other machine
checks. The command receives:

- `GOAL_ARTIFACT`
- `GOAL_TIK_PROMPT`
- `GOAL_RUN_DIR`

```toml
[tik]
provider = "agent"
model = "gpt-5.5-pro"
timeout_seconds = 1800
max_file_size_bytes = 25000000
max_output_tokens = 4096
store = false
```

Use `agent` for model-based artifact critique. The configured artifact is copied
to a temporary directory before critique.

Tik output must contain a JSON object with the configured verdict fields:

```toml
[tik.verdict]
ready_field = "artifact_ready"
blockers_field = "blocking_objections"
required_fields = ["artifact_ready", "blocking_objections"]
fingerprint_fields = ["blocking_objections", "central_bottleneck"]
```

The default verdict shape is:

```json
{
  "artifact_ready": false,
  "central_bottleneck": "one sentence",
  "blocking_objections": [],
  "required_next_artifact_changes": []
}
```

Each tik pass writes `tik.md` in the run directory. That Markdown ledger is the
machine handoff to tok: it includes artifact metadata, the raw tik memo, and the
parsed tik verdict JSON. Tok receives the whole ledger through `{tik_ledger}`;
there are no separate verdict or memo prompt placeholders.

## Tok

The production Tok mode is `codex_goal`.

```toml
[tok]
provider = "codex_goal"
write_dirs = ["writing", "src"]
sandbox = "workspace-write"
codex_features = ["goals"]
```

`codex_goal` launches `codex exec` with an internal `/goal` prompt, the local
Codex `goals` feature enabled, and a JSON Schema for the final tok report.
`write_dirs` must stay inside the project root and must not overlap `.git`,
state directories, run directories, generated directories, or the canonical
artifact.

Tok reports must match this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "source_change_possible": true,
  "revision_strategy": "one sentence",
  "sources_changed": ["path"],
  "expected_artifact_visible_improvement": ["visible change in next artifact"],
  "remaining_artifact_bottleneck": "one sentence"
}
```

If no bounded source change is possible, tok reports
`"source_change_possible": false`; the runtime records
`blocked_no_source_change_possible`.

## no-mistakes Gate

`goal-cli` can use `kunchenguid/no-mistakes` as the Git gate for heartbeat
checkpoints.

```toml
[no_mistakes]
binary = "no-mistakes"
mode = "lightspeed"
branch_prefix = "goal-cli"
skip_steps = []
timeout_seconds = 0
checkpoint_message = "goal-cli checkpoint: {goal_name} heartbeat {iteration} {phase}"
```

- `enabled`: defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` only for isolated tests or
  diagnostics that intentionally run outside Git.
- `binary`: executable used for `no-mistakes`.
- `mode`: no-mistakes pipeline preset. Defaults to `lightspeed`, which passes
  `--skip review,test,document,lint,push,pr,ci`. `fast` skips only
  `push,pr,ci`. `full` runs no-mistakes without preset skips.
- `branch_prefix`: prefix for the feature branch created when the repo is on the
  default branch, because `no-mistakes axi run` refuses default branches.
- `skip_steps`: optional no-mistakes pipeline steps for `--skip`, such as
  `["test", "lint"]`. These are added to the selected `mode` preset.
- `timeout_seconds`: process timeout for `no-mistakes` commands; `0` means no
  timeout.
- `checkpoint_message`: Git commit message template. Available placeholders are
  `{goal_name}`, `{iteration}`, and `{phase}`.

When enabled, goal-cli prepares the repo before a non-dry-run heartbeat by ignoring
`.goal/` in `.git/info/exclude`, auto-branching if needed, and checkpointing
dirty project changes. After successful tok and completion heartbeats, it
checkpoints again, runs `no-mistakes init`, and then runs:

```bash
no-mistakes axi run --intent "<configured or generated intent>" --yes [--skip ...]
```

Missing Git setup, a missing no-mistakes binary, or a failed gate records
`blocked_no_mistakes_failed`.

## Observability

OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled by default and exports standard OTLP HTTP
traces. `goal-cli` only instruments runtime stages; collectors, storage, and
dashboards come from existing OpenTelemetry-compatible tools. If the configured
OTLP receiver is not reachable and no OTLP endpoint was explicitly set through
the environment, `goal-cli` writes local fallback traces to
`.goal/observability/traces.jsonl`. For collector-managed agent-side
observation, use `docs/otel-collector-file.yaml` with OpenTelemetry Collector
Contrib and read `.goal/observability/traces.json`.

```toml
[observability]
service_name = "goal-cli"
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
timeout_seconds = 5
```

- `enabled`: defaults to `true`.
- `service_name`: OpenTelemetry `service.name` resource attribute.
- `endpoint`: OTLP HTTP traces endpoint used when
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` are not
  set.
- `timeout_seconds`: OTLP exporter timeout used when OpenTelemetry timeout env
  vars are not set.

Standard OpenTelemetry environment variables are respected. Set
`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` or `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` for isolated tests.
Environment-provided OTLP endpoints are treated as explicit operator intent and
are not replaced by the local JSONL fallback.

Emitted spans include:

- `goal_cli.heartbeat.run`
- `goal_cli.heartbeat`
- `goal_cli.producer`
- `goal_cli.artifact.load`
- `goal_cli.tik`
- `goal_cli.tok`
- `goal_cli.no_mistakes.prepare`
- `goal_cli.no_mistakes.gate`

## Prompt Placeholders

Tik prompts may use:

- `{goal_name}`
- `{artifact_path}`
- `{artifact_sha256}`
- `{producer_command}`

Tok prompts may use:

- `{goal_name}`
- `{producer_command}`
- `{artifact_path}`
- `{artifact_sha256}`
- `{tik_ledger}`
- `{tik_path}`
- `{writable_scopes}`
- `{run_dir}`

Runtime prompts must stay closed-system. They may describe the artifact,
producer, tik ledger, writable scopes, budgets, and operational
impossibilities. They must not include a person-facing approval, clarification,
or decision path.

## Safety

```toml
[safety]
generated_dirs = ["output", "build"]
max_blocker_repeats = 3
lock_stale_seconds = 21600
max_history_items = 50
```

- `generated_dirs`: protected generated outputs; tok write scopes cannot
  overlap them.
- `max_blocker_repeats`: repeated identical tik objections block the run.
- `lock_stale_seconds`: stale lock age.
- `max_history_items`: retained state history entries.

## Setup Readiness

Run:

```bash
goal-cli doctor
```

Doctor is the static readiness gate for configured artifact execution. It
checks:

- config validity, prompt placeholders, closed-system prompt language, and
  writable-scope safety;
- artifact, state, and run directory creatability;
- configured producer command availability where the shell command is statically
  knowable;
- oracle tik command availability where applicable;
- Codex CLI availability;
- OpenTelemetry package availability and the runtime telemetry export plan
  (OTLP when reachable or explicitly environment-configured, local JSONL
  fallback otherwise);
- `codex exec` support for `--output-schema`, `--output-last-message`,
  `--enable`, `--add-dir`, and `--sandbox`;
- agent tik `openai` package and `OPENAI_API_KEY` readiness when
  `tik.provider = "agent"`.

The default summary reports `static_setup`. If it is ready, `goal-cli run` has
the local setup required to start the producer/tik/tok loop for the
canonical artifact.

For an opt-in tok smoke check:

```bash
goal-cli doctor --smoke-codex-goal
```

The smoke check starts a minimal internal Codex `/goal` in a temporary writable
directory and validates the schema-shaped tok report. It does not touch
project sources. `one_click_artifact_loop` is only ready after this check passes.

## Runtime Units

- `heartbeat`: one autonomous producer/tik/tok pass.
- `run`: one CLI invocation that executes exactly one heartbeat.
